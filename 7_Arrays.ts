//ARRAY DECLARATION

let list1 : number[] = [1,2,3];
let list2 : array<number> = [1,2,3];

//In TypeScript we can have an array with data of different data types
//for declaring arrays of 2 data types
//we can use tuple
//example-

let person : [string,number] = [Anshul,1];

//tuple can have limited no of values and order also has to be same
